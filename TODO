I. Revise/refactor
    A. Speed/Rerunnability:
      1. p3b: Go through execution times of cells in various cells and replace dictionary comprehensions w/ progress reports 
          a. w/ joblib-parallelized generator expresions.
          b. and add checks for whether the file already exists that the dictionary in question will be exported to.
    B. Papermill + Parameters
      1. p2a, p3a (and to a lesser extent p3b) take parameters that affect their behavior (viz. what data they look at and what they do with it). Edit them for papermill compatibility so this can be done via CLI.
    C. Reaching towards Buckeye, CELEX, and Dutch
      1. Figure out functions/files that you need for any given lexicon for
          a. identifying alignment issues with gating data.
          b. specifying how to resolve alignment issues.
          c. modify p1ab, p2ab, maybe p3b accordingly
    D. Sanity checking / phonetic analysis
      1. Stress: Run p3a w/ following parameters:
          a. unaligned/stressed/0
              - currently this fails in \S 5.6.1 because 'lÌ©0' in uniphone_dist has a norm of 0.5
          b. unaligned/stressed/001
          a. Hammond/stressed/0
          b. Hammond/stressed/001
              - currently this fails in \S 5.6.1 because 'l0' in uniphone_dist has a norm of 0.5
          c. IPhOD/stressed/0
          d. IPhOD/stressed/001
      2. p4a
      3. p4bnt2
          a. fix incorrect probability calculations (source/prefix probabilities) and exports
          b. cousin calculations should /follow/ 3.1.7.1.
          c.
